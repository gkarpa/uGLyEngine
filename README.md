# uGLy Engine
uGLy is a small modern OpenGL rendering framework I've been developing in my spare time for fun and educational purposes.
I am trying to abstract common functionality and make it easier to reuse, so in uGLy you can find entities like a scene, camera (both FPS and orbit cameras), lights (point light, directional light), meshes, textures, materials, shaders, rendering programs, skybox etc.

uGLy uses [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net) for its mathematics library and [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for the opengl function loading.
