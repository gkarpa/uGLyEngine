# uGLy Engine
uGLy is a small modern OpenGL rendering framework I've been developing in my spare time for fun and educational purposes.
I am trying to abstract common functionality and make it easier to reuse, so in uGLy you can find entities like a scene, camera (both FPS and orbit cameras), lights (point light, directional light), meshes, textures, materials, shaders, rendering programs, skybox etc. The various test 3d models that I'm using can be found freely available on the web.

uGLy uses [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net) for its mathematics library and [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for the opengl function loading.

You can see some screenshots made with uGLy and my other sibling project, [uGLyRenderer](https://github.com/gkarpa/uGLyRenderer), below.
